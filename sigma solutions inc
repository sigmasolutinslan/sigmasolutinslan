Hey everybody. I have been writing 2000 word articles for the past month or so and was just wondering if this is what it takes to succeed in the online world these days? I have done some research on this and found that 1500-2000 word articles often do better than 500 word articles and this is clearly because of the amount of content and information that you can give your visitor. I have been starting to get more daily traffic and now have 176 comments of people saying that they are bookmarking my site and will be back to read more. This is pretty cool as I've only had the site for 4 months and it is my very 1st one. I also have a very low bounce rate and they are staying on my site for an average session of 7:33. I currently have 46 articles and have been adding a new one about once a week. I read somewhere that this increases the amount of views that each article has and will often give you repeat visitors when you add something new. I was just thinking if I keep this up at a rate of one article a week I should have 78 articles by the time I have had the site for a year and think I should be doing a lot better in the rankings by then. What do you think about this idea and how long did it take for you to start making a profit from adding articles? Thanks alot
